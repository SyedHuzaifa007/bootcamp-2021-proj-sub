### This is my first project of Bootcamp-2021
#### Project Name: **Todo App**
#### Project Descripion: 
This is a console based application for daily tasks management with a permanent storage.
#### Modules Used: 
I've used the following modules for this application:
- ```inquirer``` 

This module is used to make our application more iteractive by adding the  features of **Add New Task**, **Show/Hide Tasks**, **Mark Completed Tasks**, **Remove Completed Tasks**.
- ```lowdb```

This module is used to add a **permanent storage** feature to our application so that the user won't loss his/her old data when using this application.
